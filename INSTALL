This is the INSTALL file for the source code of the difference
software packages derived or inspired by GRASP. To install a given
package do the following:

1- Make sure that GNU's make and binutils are available in your
   machine. GRASP requires GNU make and other bin utils to build.

2- Edit the GRASP.ENV.$mach file corresponding to the architecture of
   your machine. Set the different environment variables according to
   the system you are using and to the final location of the source
   code tree. In case there is no GRAP.ENV file for your machine's
   architecture, use one of the GRASP.ENV prototypes as an example.
   Execute the command "source GRASP.ENV.$mach".

3- By default, GNU g++, make, and the other GNU utilities and assumed
   and used. The organization of each of the files Makefile and
   Make_defs.include, found in the top directory, is based on this
   choice. If you want to use a different compiler, you will have to
   go over the Makefiles and change them as needed.

4- Execute the command "printenv HOSTTYPE" and create a directory
   $HOSTTYPE below the soft/bin directory.

5- Execute the command "make hlinks" in order to install links in the
   include directory for all header files in the source code tree.

6- Execute the command "make depend" to establish the proper file
   dependencies. This can be done on the top directory and
   dependencies will be established for all directories below.

7- Examine the Makefile and decide what to install. In addition, you
   may also go to a specific directory and install only the package
   you want.


All packages have been installed and tested in SUN 4, DEC 5000/240 and
PC/Linux machines, using GNU GCC version 2.7.2. However, with GCC it
should be possible to install the software on other architectures.

If you find any problems with the software or its installation,
contact the author (see contact info below) describing the problems
you have found.
